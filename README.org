* Raw old notes

Manually symlink the .spacemacs file into the proper ~/ location 
I should probably write some kinda script for that.  whatev.
It would have to be in elisp to ensure that the proper env variable for ~/ was used. 
I am not sure how to do file operations in elisp.
and I am not set up to learn at the moment.  defer it.  

also, rename the directory you cloned from spacemacs-personal to personal
