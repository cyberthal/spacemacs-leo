* Name explained

"Leo" stands for "Leo's Ergonomic Optimizations". Leo is my first name. 

I chose "leo" rather than "cyberthal" so that the command prefix would be short and therefore easy to type.

* Install

** Install [[http://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]]

** Clone and install the layer

#+begin_src sh
# clone the layer
mkdir -p ~/1-Mansort/2-Other-text/Github/Emacs/My/Spacemacs/Leo
git clone https://github.com/cyberthal/spacemacs-leo.git  ~/1-Mansort/2-Other-text/Github/Emacs/My/Spacemacs/Leo

# deploy it
cd ~/1-Mansort/2-Other-text/Github/Emacs/My/Spacemacs/Leo
./install-nixlike.sh
#+end_src

*** to self: On development account, install dev branch on chemacs/dev

So that customizations I initiate there are saved into Dev instead of Prod.
And so that I can experiment without breaking my other machines.
So that I can dogfood before releasing.
Plus if I break something it's easy to just install /prod to recover to the last known good point.

** Add layer to =~/.spacemacs=

Add =leo= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list.

** run Spacemacs to install new packages

* Suggested Hyper keybind for MacOS

Assuming a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard with an Appkey:

1. open Karabiner Elements
2. Bind appkey to fn

(Keybind won't work through Synergy.)
