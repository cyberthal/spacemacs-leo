**** TODO [#2] rationalize spacemacs keybinds

I need to rationalize my keybinds to make sense in Spacemacs logic.
there's currently little logic to them.

**** TODO [#2] spacemacs | layer | leo | keybind | add

bind 
<C-up|down> runs the command org-backward-paragraph
to the toggle between my hands

**** TODO [#2] address agenda files in init.el

Found list of Org agenda files in my init.el again
Gotta put a stop to that!
or do I? It's not like I commit from prod.
And it's probably nice to have them stored.
It's a beginner's trap though.

**** TODO [#2] install better defaults on spacemacs/Leo

**** Spacemacs | layers | leo | FR: enhancement | proc sprinted | duplication | automate | defer

I should really automate the duplication of sprinted.
or maybe not. It's such a critical operation, wouldn't want blind automation to screw something up due to an unexpected state.
